# MERN Stack 🚀

# PART 1 - UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS:

Over the last 2 weeks, I have been learning the **MERN Stack** and covered the **basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. As a part of my learning journey, I created a **Quiz Application** called **QuizzApp** using the MERN stack.

This repository contains:
- Basic MERN stack practice code
- QuizzApp project files
